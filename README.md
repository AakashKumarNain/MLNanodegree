Machine Learning Nanodegree Projects

# Description
This repository is the part of my Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree program at Udacity. 

# Software Requirement
In order to run the projects, the following software are required:
* Python2.7
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* pygame
* keras
* theano/ TensorFlow
* Jupyter Notebook

It is highly recommended that [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) should be used for creating an environment that satisfies the above requirements.
